# The-impact-of-weather-in-the-coronavirus-spread   
With more than 775 748 peoples infected and 37109 deaths (03/30/2020) and with a significative decrease of usual human activity, the COVID-19 will be remembered as a sad part of mankind's history. I, like many others, am trying to keep doing what I love to do and avoid get crazy thinking about the impact of this crisis in my family and people around the World. I am not a politician, I don't have any kind of power, but, at the same time, I feel that I need to do something else, and for that reason I began this project as a modest contribution of what I think could be some interesting open questions about the COVID-19:

1. Is there some relationship between the temperature and the spread of the virus? In such a case, what is the minimum temperature that help to slow down it spread?
2. Has the humidity some kind of impact on the spread of the virus?
3. What happens with the virus at different atmospheric pressures?
