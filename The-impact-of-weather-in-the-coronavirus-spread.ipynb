    "The World stopped and the fear is around any corner of the planet, everybody speaks about the same and the humans seem powerless in front of a microscopic enemy. With more than 775 748 peoples infected and 37109 deaths (03/30/2020) and with a significative decrease of usual human activity, the COVID-19 will be remembered as a sad part of mankind's history.\n",

    "I, like many others, am trying to keep doing what I love to do and avoid get crazy thinking about the impact of this crisis in my family and people around the World. I am not a politician, I don't have any kind of power, unfortunately, I'm not a doctor or nurse, and even when I have some ideas and hypotheses about what could be done to get through this crisis (as any other person), I only have my family and potentially my group of 50 friends in Facebook to share it. But, at the same time, I feel that I need to do something else, and for that reason, I began this project as a modest contribution of what I think could be some interesting open questions about the COVID-19.\n",

    "These are questions:\n",
    "1. Is there is a relationship between the coronavirus spread and the weather?\n",
    "2. Is there any difference in the number of deaths and recoveries by gender between countries?\n",
    "3. Is there a relationship between the number of cases and population density in the US?"

    "For this study I considered the weather in the last 4 months (December 1 to March 29) of 9 differents cities. The selection criterion was:\n",
    "* Include the most infected city of the 3 countries with more cases. At 30/03/2020 these countries were US, Italy, and Spain, and the cities were \"New York\" (US), the region of \"Lombardia\" in Italy (in this case we selected Milan, which is the capital of Lombardia), and Madrid (Spain) (see details in the subsection [Most infected city of the 3 countries with more cases](#sec:most_infected_cities)).\n",
    "* Include the city with a greater number of cases for the 3 coldest countries. The list with the coldest countries in the World was obtained from [here](https://www.swedishnomad.com/coldest-countries-in-the-world/) taking into account the average yearly temperature. \n",
    "    * The results show that the coldest countries with more cases are \"Austria\", \"Norway\", and \"Sweden\" with 9618, 4445 and 4028 cases respectively. For these countries the most afected cities are Vienna (Austria's capital), Oslo (Norway's capital) and Stockholm (Sweden's capital). For details, see the subsection [Cities in Coldest-Countries](sec:coldest_countries). \n",
    "* Include the city with a greater number of cases for the 3 hottest countries. A list with the 15 hottest countries given the average yearly temperature was obtained from [here](https://www.swedishnomad.com/hottest-countries-in-the-world/). \n",
    "    * Given these selection parameters, I obtained that the hottest 3 countries with the greatest number of cases are Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Burkina Faso with 693, 611 and 246 cases respectively. I can't found a free access to the weather data of Burkina Faso and as consequence I pick the next country in the list, which is Senegal with 162 cases. The historic weather in the capitals of these 3 countries (Doha, Dubai, Dakar) were selected for this analysis (see details in the subsection [Cities in Hottest-Countries](#sec:hottest_countries)).\n",

    "Now it's time to begin to explore the relationship between the temperature and the number of new cases. Fig. _New Infections vs Temperature_ shows that the greatest number of infections occurs in cities with a mean temperature between $40$ and $60^o F$. This is the case of New York, Madrid, and Lombardia with a median temperature of $47.5^o F$, $50.5^o F$ and $47.75^o F$ respectively.     \n",
    "Note that for temperatures over $65^o F$ the numbers of infections seems to be very low in comparison with the other regions with lowest temperatures. Also, as we advertise previously, Quebec is the province with the lowest temperature, and also seems to has a low number of new infections in comparison with the regions with temperatures between $40$ and $60^o F$, but more than those regions with high temperatures.\n",
    "> Even when this is not concluded, we can hypothesize that if the temperature has an impact on the spread of the Coronavirus, then:\n",
    "1. The spread is reduced significatively when the temperature is over $\\approx 65^o F$.\n",
    "2. It's more probable to have more infections when the temperature varies between $40$ and $60^o F$ approximately.\n",
    "3. For temperatures under the $\\approx 35^o F$, the spread seems to be less than when the temperature is between $40$ and $60^o F$ but greater than for regions with temperatures over $65^o F$. In resume, the cold seems to be a factor that impacts the spread of the virus but less than hight temperatures."

Fig. _Temperature ranges and New Infections_ shows that the number of new infections is around 250 000 across all the `Province/State` when the temperature is between $40$ and $60^o F$, which is significantly higher than the two other ranges. Also, this histogram shows that the number of total new cases when the temperature is under $40^o F$ ($\\approx 35 000$) is notably bigger than when the temperature is over the $60^o F$, in which case our data only report around 10 000 new infections."

Nevertheless, it has been reported that samples with more than 15 observations (there are at least 25 in each of our distributions) are enough to avoid the normality assumption in the case of two samples t-student hypothesis test (see [here](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/Assistant_Two_Sample_t.pdf), or [here](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fZZTBgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&ots=KVNzlTQZBU&sig=uc2nGPRKmXFRx5q5d627Vf2ndPc#v=onepage&q&f=false), and also [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693611/)). I am not happy with this number of samples, but, in this case, it's important to make inference over the mean (parametric case) and not over the median (nonparametric case) Why? Because we need to take into account if exists a high number of new infections. Also, the nonparametric tests assume that all groups must have the same or very similar spread (variance), which doesn't seem to be the case in our data. Finally, a parametric test (like t-student) gives more statistical power to the test (less probability to fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false)."
