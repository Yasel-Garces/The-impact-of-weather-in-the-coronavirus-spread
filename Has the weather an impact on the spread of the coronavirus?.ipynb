    "With more than 775 748 peoples infected and 37109 deaths (03/30/2020) and with a significative decrease of usual human activity, the COVID-19 will be remembered as a sad part of mankind's history. I, like many others, am trying to keep doing what I love to do and avoid get crazy thinking about the impact of this crisis in my family and people around the World. I am not a politician, I don't have any kind of power, I'm not a doctor or nurse, and even when I have some ideas and hypotheses about what could be done to get through this crisis (as any other person), I only have my family and potentially my group of 50 friends in Facebook to share it. But, at the same time, I feel that I need to do something else, and for that reason I began this project as a modest contribution of what I think could be some interesting open questions about the COVID-19.\n",

    "These are the questions:\n",
    "1. Is there some relationship between the temperature and the spread of the virus? In such a case, what is the minimum temperature that help to slow down it spread?\n",
    "2. Has the humidity some kind of impact on the spread of the virus?\n",
    "3. What happens with the virus at different atmospheric pressures?\n",

    "For this study I considered the weather in the last 4 months (December 1 to March 29) of 9 differents cities. The selection criterion was:\n",
    "* Include the most infected city of the 3 countries with more cases. At 2020-04-03 these countries were US, Italy, and Spain, and the cities were \"New York\" (US), the region of \"Lombardia\" in Italy (in this case we selected Milan, which is the capital of Lombardia), and Madrid (Spain) (see details in the subsection [Cities in Countries with more Infections](#cities_in_countries_with_more_infections)).\n",
    "* Include the city with a greater number of cases in the 3 coldest countries. The list with the coldest countries in the World was obtained from [here](https://www.swedishnomad.com/coldest-countries-in-the-world/) taking into account the average yearly temperature.  \n",
    "    * The results show that the coldest countries with more cases are \"Austria\", \"Sweden\", and Canada with 11524, 6131 and 6101 cases respectively. For these countries the most afected cities are Vienna (Austria's capital), Stockholm (Sweden's capital), and Quebec in Canada. For details, see the subsection [Cities in Coldest-Countries](#coldest_countries). \n",
    "* Include the city with a greater number of cases in the 3 hottest countries. A list with the 15 hottest countries given the average yearly temperature was obtained from [here](https://www.swedishnomad.com/hottest-countries-in-the-world/). \n",
    "    * Given these selection parameters, I obtained that the hottest 3 countries with the greatest number of cases are United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Burkina Faso with 1264, 1075 and 302 cases respectively. Unfortunately, I can't found free weather information about Burkina Faso, and as consequence I pick the next country in the list, which is Senegal with 207 cases. The weather of the cities with more cases of these 3 countries (Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Doha (Qatar), Dakar (Senegal)) were selected for this analysis (see details in the subsection [Cities in Hottest-Countries](#hottest_countries)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unfortunately, it was very difficult for me to find accurate information about the weather by country/cities in the last 4 months. All the webpages sell this information (and is very expensive by the way), so, I collected and curated manually this data. If anybody has or knows where to obtain this kind of data easily, please, share this information. If you want to use this information, it is available[here](https://github.com/Yasel-Garces/The-impact-of-weather-in-the-coronavirus-spread)."

If a person \"X\" was reported as infected at the day \"D\", then the exposure occurred [between 2-14 days before](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). I am going to assume here that the mean of persons with the disease has the first symptoms on day 8 (the mean between 2 and 14) after exposure. This is, the weather that matter in the infection of \"X\" is the weather in the day (\"D\" - 8).\n",

    "Now it's time to begin to explore the relationship between the temperature and the number of new cases. Fig. _\"New Infections vs Temperature\"_ (below) shows that the greatest number of infections occurs in cities with a mean temperature between $40$ and $60^o F$. This is the case of New York, Madrid, and Lombardia with a median temperature of $47.5^o F$, $50.5^o F$ and $47.75^o F$ respectively.     \n",
    "Note that for temperatures over $65^o F$ the numbers of infections seems to be very low in comparison with the other regions with lowest temperatures. Also, as we advertise previously, Quebec is the province with the lowest temperature, and also seems to has a low number of new infections in comparison with the regions with temperatures between $40$ and $60^o F$.\n",
    "> Given this graph, we can hypothesize that if the temperature has an impact on the spread of the Coronavirus, then:\n",
    "1. The spread is reduced significatively when the temperature is over $\\approx 65^o F$.\n",
    "2. It's more probable to have more infections when the temperature varies between $40$ and $60^o F$ approximately.\n",
    "3. For temperatures under the $\\approx 35^o F$, the spread seems to be less than when the temperature is between $40$ and $60^o F$ but greater than regions with temperatures over $65^o F$. In resume, the cold seems to be a factor that impacts the spread of the virus but less than hight temperatures."

Also, this histogram shows that the number of new cases when the temperature is under $40^o F$ ($\\approx 35 000$) is notably bigger than when the temperature is over the $60^o F$, in which case our data only report around 10 000 new infections."

    "Our objective is to compare if the distribution of the new infections in two different cities comes from the same population or not. In other words, the null hypothesis is that the spread of the virus is independent of the temperature, and the alternative hypothesis is that the spread is lower in cities with high temperatures. \n",
    "  \n",
    "The distributions of the new infections are independent but also are far away from following a normal distribution (see Fig. _\"New Infections Histogram by Province/State\"_ below).  Nevertheless, it has been reported that samples with more than 15 observations (there are at least 25 in each of our distributions) are enough to avoid the normality assumption in the case of two samples t-student hypothesis test (see [here](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/Assistant_Two_Sample_t.pdf), or [here](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fZZTBgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&ots=KVNzlTQZBU&sig=uc2nGPRKmXFRx5q5d627Vf2ndPc#v=onepage&q&f=false), and also [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693611/)). I'm not happy with this number of samples, but, in this case, it's important to make inference over the mean (parametric case) and not over the median (nonparametric case) Why? Because we need to take into account if exists a high number of new infections. Also, the nonparametric tests assume that all groups must have the same or very similar spread (variance), which doesn't seem to be the case in our data. Finally, a parametric test (like t-student) gives more statistical power to the test (less probability to fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false)."

This is, if X, Y are the two samples to compare with length $l_X$ and $l_Y$ respectively, and $\\hat{l}=min(l_X,l_Y)$, then I am only going to consider the observations of X and Y between the first infection day and the day $\\hat{l}$.\n",
    "> The above could look tricky, but in fact, it has an easy explanation, and it is that we need to compare the same number of days after the first infection because in the other way we are introducing a bias based on the lack of information in the distribution with fewer observations."

    "The  results obtained through the `stats.ttest_ind` function are relatives to a [two-tailed test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html), and for that reason, I divided the p-value by 2 (one-tailed test), and print the t-statistic. \n",
    "* If $p/2<0.05$ and $t>0$ then we are on the right tail of the distribution and we can affirm that the mean of new cases in warm regions is greater than in other regions, \n",
    "* If $p/2<0.05$ and $t<0$ we can conclude that the mean of new cases is lesser when the temperature is upper $60^o F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 12 of the 16 hypothesis tests, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (the mean of the people infected in regions with temperatures under $60^o F$ is more than regions with temperatures over $60^o F$). Nevertheless, it may be interesting to study what happened in these 4 cases where we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In my opinion, a nice way to see this is to relate the number of new infections by day. Fig. _\"New Infections and Average Temperature by Day (Madrid, Dakar, Doha)\"_ shows this relationship in the case of Madrid, Dakar and Doha (note that we fail to reject the null hyphotesis in the test between \"Madrid vs Doha\" and \"Madrid vs Dakar\"), and is easy to see an interesting patter here:\n",
    "1. We have only $\\approx 32$ days in common between the three distributions (number of days since the first infection).\n",
    "2. Madrid and Dakar have almost the same number of infections by day until day 32, while some days Doha seems to have more infections than Madrid, which explains why we fail to reject the null hypothesis in these case, but this isn't all:\n",
    "    1. After day 32, the number of cases increases exponentially in Madrid, but we don't have more information about Doha or Dakar because at this moment these regions only had one month since the first infection.  \n",
    "    2. The temperature in Madrid doesn't suffer big changes after day 32 (see Fig. _\"New Infections and Average Temperature by Day\"_), so, this doesn't seem to be the factor that shot the number of infections.\n",
    "    > At this point we can formulate two hypothesis:\n",
    "        1. The spread of the virus in Doha and Dakar is following a pattern very similar to the case of Madrid, and in the following days, we are going to see an exponential increase in the number of new infections in these regions (I don't believe that this is the case if we also consider that the number of new infections in Dubai is stable and close to zero).\n",
    "        2. Other factors (like socioculturals) make a huge impact in the spread of the virus. This looks like a more reasonable hypothesis, but we are not going deeper here because this topic is beyond the scope of this project."

You can see in Fig. _\"New Infections and Average Temperature by Day (Stockholm, Dakar, Doha)\"_ that the number of cases increases exponentially in Stockholm after the first 35 days of the first infection. The conclusions explained before in the case of Madrid are extensible to this case, and we need to wait for more information to draw conclusions in these four regions comparison."

    "The p-value is in the order of $10^{-19}$ ==> Reject the null hypothesis that the population medians of all of the groups are equal, and as consequence, exist differences in the humidity between cities. Now, we need to do a post hoc test to see which groups are different. For this, I am going to use [Dunn's tests](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.1964.10490181) as a post hoc with a [Bonferroni correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) of the p-value, and this is justified because:\n",

    "* Dunn's test employs the pooled variance implied by the null hypothesis of the Kruskal-Wallis test. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance#cite_note-Dunn-5) for more information.    \n",

    "The next heatmap shows the results of the post hoc test, and if we take into account our previous study about the differences between the number of new infections, we can infer that the humidity doesn't have any influence on the spread of the virus. For example, in the first 25 days of infection, New York had 195 times more cases than Doha and 7922 times that Dubai, but our test revealed that don't exist statistical differences between the humidity of these regions. On the other hand, there is a significant difference between the humidity in Madrid and Dakar but as we analyzed in the previous section, there are no differences between the distribution of the new infections of these two regions.   \n",

    "According to [Gay-Lussac's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay-Lussac%27s_law) the pressure and the temperatures are directly proportional to each other, so, if the temperature increase, the pressure increase, and vice-versa. Some good examples and explanations are available [here](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-relationship-between-air-temperature-air-162931).\n",
    "> \"An easy way to understand this concept is by comparing car tires in the winter and car tires in the summer. In the summer the air is a lot warmer so the molecules are moving around a lot. The tire expands and you not need as much air because the pressure in the tires is high enough. In the winter, when the air is cold, the molecules are moving very slowly. Many people need to add more air to their tires because there is not enough pressure.\"    \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if these two variables are correlated and we analyzed the temperature, there is no reason to analyze the pressure, right? Maybe, but no soo fast! There is another atmospheric relationship that we don't talk yet and it is that the [pressure drops as altitude increases](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/atmospheric-pressure/), and as the pressure decrease the amount of oxygen also decreases. Now, do you think that it's valid to study the relationship between the altitude of the province or states as a factor in the spread of the virus? It seems unlikely that this could be a key factor but at least we can get out of the doubt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The altitude in feet and meters of our 9 `Province/State` are included in the next table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Province/State | Altitude     |\n",
    "|----------------|--------------|\n",
    "| New York       | 33' (10m)    |\n",
    "| Madrid         | 2188' (667m) |\n",
    "| Doha           | 33' (10m)    |\n",
    "| Dakar          | 72' (22m)    |\n",
    "| Dubai          | 52' (16m)    |\n",
    "| Lombardia      | 390' (120m)  |\n",
    "| Quebec         | 322' (98m)   |\n",
    "| Stockholm      | 62' (19m)    |\n",
    "| Vienna         | 2273' (350m) |\n",
    "\n",
    "The region with more altitude is Madrid followed by Vienna and Lombardia,  while New York, Doha, and Dubai have very close altitudes. The case of Madrid is interesting because we know that this city is one of the three with more cases worldwide. Fig. _\"Boxplot Pressure by Province/Stats\"_ shows that as was expected, Madrid has a significantly lower pressure than the other regions. So, if the pressure given the altitude is a factor in the spread of the virus, we should expect that the number of infections in Madrid will be greater (lower) than each of the other regions."

    "At this point, the objective is to see if exists differences in the number of infections in each of the three pair of cities defined before. Based on the same explanation given in Section [Coronavirus vs Temperature](#coronavirus_vs_temperature), we are going to use a one tail t-student test with critical value $\\alpha=0.05$. Again, the null hypothesis is that there aren't differences in the mean of the number of new infections between the cities and the alternative is that there is.    \n",
    "The results (see data frame below) are extremely interesting! Note that in all the comparisons we obtained that the number of new infections in Madrid is significantly lower (from a statistical point of view) than in all the other regions with similar temperatures. Also, the population density in Madrid is greater than the other three regions, so, this doesn't seem to be the factor that explains this difference.    \n",
    "What do you think about this? Is it not weird? I think it is, and this is because currently, we know that Madrid is one of the three regions with more cases, so, what happened here?     \n",
    "* This effect is given because (as we did before) we are only considering the common maximum number of days since the first infection between both cities. Remember that I made this decision as a way to mitigate the effect that cities with a greater number of days are more likely to have more cases.\n",
    "* If we observe the relationship of the number of new cases by city and the number of days since the first infection (Fig. _\"New Infections by Day (Madrid, New York, Lombardia, Vienna)\"_ below), it is easy to see that our dataset only have the information of Vienna and Lombardia in approximately 40 days, and in those first 40 days, Madrid has fewer infections than these two regions and New York, so, this is the reason why we are obtaining significant statistical differences.\n",
    "* Now, the number of cases increased exponentially in Madrid after  40 days of infection, so, maybe these differences in the first 40 days are just a random effect and are not related with the altitude, or the altitude has an effect in the spread of the virus, but a new factor took effect in Madrid after the 40 first days and mitigated the effect of the altitude.    \n",
    "> At this point, this analysis is something interesting but is far away to be conclusive! A lot more data and analysis are necessary if we want to prove this hypothesis."

    "## Conclusions and Remarks\n",
    "<a id='conclusions_and_remarks'></a>\n",
    "1. Temperatures over the $60^o F$ seems to affect the spread of the virus.\n",
    "2. The humidity doesn't seem to be an environmental factor that affects the spread of the virus.\n",
    "3. Our data shows that in the case of Madrid, the pressure given the altitude had a negative effect on the spread of the virus (reduced the spread) in the first 40 days of infection, but these results are not conclusive and we need a lot of more data to have a better idea of this effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks\n",
    "* In my opinion, the study of only 9 cities (even when the cities were selected with a logical criterion) is not enough to draw valid conclusions about general climatological conditions that affect or not the spread of the virus independently of the city or region. \n",
    "* There are a lot of factors, like the sociocultural ones, that have a strong incidence in the spread of the virus independently of the weather. Assuming (like I did) that these factors are going to be similar between different regions is a long shot, but it is the only way at this moment to contrast different weather conditions with the number of new infections.\n",
    "* In this project, we only developed a univariate statistical analysis about the influence of 3 weather variables with the number of new infections, but a multivariate analysis would be great to elucidate more complex relationships between the weather and the spread of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a lot of work remains to do, and more data it's necessary if we want to provide accurate answers. All the codes and datasets employed in this project are available [here](https://github.com/Yasel-Garces/The-impact-of-weather-in-the-coronavirus-spread), and if you have or know where to find more open/free weather data to improve this analysis, please let me know. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Meanwhile, would be great to know what you think about the impact of the weather in the spread of the coronavirus or your opinion about the questions that remain open in this work.\n",
